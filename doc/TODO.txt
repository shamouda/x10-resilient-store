Tasks:
------
Get(key) should access only one replica

Distributed Commit:
 - No need to abort a Replica that voted NO for commit 
 
Dead Places Handling:
 - Dead Leader
 - Dead Deputy Leader
 - Dead Replica
 - Dead ReplicaClient
 
TimeOut Handling:
 - Replica waiting for Replica Client
 - ReplicaClient waiting for Replica
 - Migration cases??
 
Serialization:
 - Currently keys and values are copied by "at". 
   For large objects (like matrix blocks), this will be slow compared to using Rail.asyncCopy.  
 
Test Cases:
 - Stress Testing
 - Performance Benchmarking
 
 
- Migration:
  How to suspend transactions while migrating????
  
- Before issuing a request, if replicas are dead,  make the user wait till migration is complete !!!!
Should we better throw an exception here?
no, because the application will keep repeating the request multiple times and getting exceptions
better hold the request
